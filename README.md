# 🌟 Day 87 — GFG 160 Days DSA Challenge
### 🔼 Problem: Maximum Path Sum from Any Node in a Binary Tree
### 🧠 Problem Statement:
Given a binary tree, determine the maximum path sum, where the path may start and end at any node. A node’s value may be positive or negative.

## 💡 Solution Strategy:
✔️ Post-order traversal (DFS-based)
✔️ Used a helper function that returns max gain from subtrees
✔️ Carefully handled negative values using max(0, subtree_sum) to ensure optimal results
✔️ At every node, computed current_path_sum = node + left + right
✔️ Tracked global max_sum for the best possible answer

## 🧪 Result Highlights:
✅ Test Cases Passed: 320 / 320

🎯 Accuracy: 100%

🕒 Time Taken: 0.14 sec

🏆 Points Earned: 4 / 4

📊 Total Score: 335

## 📌 Key Takeaway:
“Not all paths lead to the root, but every optimal path must be rooted in strategy.” 💡🌱
